# Quick Fix Summary - Motion Import Issue

## üö® Issue Resolved
**Error**: `ReferenceError: motion is not defined` in VideoPlayer.jsx at line 337

## üîç Root Cause
During the optimization process, the `motion` import was incorrectly removed from `VideoPlayer.jsx`, but the component still uses `motion.div` for the upload popup modal animations.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied
**Restored the motion import in VideoPlayer.jsx:**

```jsx
// BEFORE (causing error):
import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';
import { Play, Upload, Link, ChevronDown, File, Folder, X, Video, AlertCircle } from 'lucide-react';

// AFTER (fixed):
import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { Play, Upload, Link, ChevronDown, File, Folder, X, Video, AlertCircle } from 'lucide-react';
```

## üéØ Motion Usage in VideoPlayer
The `motion` import is required for:
- Upload popup modal animations (lines 337-373)
- Smooth enter/exit transitions for the file upload dialog
- Enhanced user experience with glassmorphism effects
